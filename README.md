---

# 6. Local Development Setup

## Requirements

Install the following before starting development:

* Node.js
* Git
* VS Code
* PostgreSQL/Supabase access
* pnpm or npm

Verify installation:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

If using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

---

# 7. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or:

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

# 8. Environment Configuration

Create a local environment file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Example configuration:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

DATABASE_URL=

API_URL=
PORT=
```

### Important

Never commit:

```text
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

Never expose:

```text
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
DATABASE_PASSWORD
PRIVATE_API_KEYS
JWT_SECRETS
```

Only public client-side values should be exposed through frontend environment variables.

---

# 9. Run the Development Environment

Frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The frontend will normally be available at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

The backend port depends on the project's environment configuration.

---

# 10. Git Development Workflow

The `main` branch should represent the stable production-ready codebase.

Do not directly develop experimental features on `main`.

Recommended workflow:

```text
main
 │
 ├── develop
 │    │
 │    ├── feature/service-routing
 │    ├── feature/cms-services
 │    ├── feature/authentication
 │    └── fix/mobile-navigation
 │
 └── release/*
```

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

After development:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add municipal service routing"
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request for review.

---

# 11. Commit Convention

Use meaningful commit messages.

Recommended format:

```text
feat: add service detail routing
fix: resolve mobile navigation issue
refactor: simplify service data layer
docs: update deployment instructions
style: improve service card layout
test: add service routing tests
chore: update dependencies
security: restrict admin storage policy
```

Avoid commits such as:

```text
update
final
final2
asdf
changes
works
```

---

# 12. Core Functional Modules

The platform should progressively deliver the following modules.

## Public Website

* [ ] Home
* [ ] About Talibon
* [ ] Municipal Officials
* [ ] Departments and Offices
* [ ] Government Services
* [ ] Service Details
* [ ] Requirements
* [ ] Fees
* [ ] Processing Time
* [ ] Contact Information
* [ ] News
* [ ] Announcements
* [ ] Events
* [ ] Downloadable Documents
* [ ] Emergency Information
* [ ] Search

---

# 13. Municipal Services Module

Every service should have structured information.

Example:

```text
Service
├── Service Name
├── Department
├── Description
├── Eligibility
├── Requirements
├── Steps
├── Fees
├── Processing Time
├── Office Location
├── Contact Information
├── Availability
└── Related Documents
```

The system should avoid storing important service information as unstructured hard-coded HTML wherever possible.

This enables:

* CMS management
* Search
* Filtering
* Future APIs
* Analytics
* Service status
* Online application workflows

---

# 14. CMS / Administration

Authorized municipal personnel should be able to manage content through an administrative interface.

Expected CMS capabilities:

* [ ] Create content
* [ ] Edit content
* [ ] Publish content
* [ ] Unpublish content
* [ ] Archive content
* [ ] Upload documents
* [ ] Manage images
* [ ] Manage services
* [ ] Manage departments
* [ ] Manage announcements
* [ ] Manage news
* [ ] Manage users
* [ ] View system activity

---

# 15. User Roles

The system should follow least-privilege access.

Suggested roles:

```text
super_admin
    │
    ├── Full system administration
    │
admin
    │
    ├── General platform administration
    │
editor
    │
    ├── Content creation and editing
    │
municipal_admin
    │
    ├── Municipal-level administration
    │
barangay_admin
    │
    └── Barangay-specific management
```

Permissions should be enforced on the backend/database level, not only through frontend UI hiding.

---

# 16. Security Requirements

Security is a **production requirement**, not an optional enhancement.

Before production deployment:

* [ ] Authentication is implemented
* [ ] Authorization is enforced
* [ ] Protected routes are verified
* [ ] RLS policies are reviewed
* [ ] Storage policies are reviewed
* [ ] Admin privileges are restricted
* [ ] Sensitive environment variables are protected
* [ ] Input validation is implemented
* [ ] API endpoints are protected
* [ ] File upload restrictions are implemented
* [ ] Database permissions are reviewed
* [ ] Error messages do not expose sensitive information
* [ ] Production secrets are rotated when necessary
* [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities are reviewed
* [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are documented

---

# 17. Database Requirements

The database should follow:

* Normalized relational design
* Foreign key integrity
* Appropriate indexes
* Clear naming conventions
* UUIDs where appropriate
* Timestamp tracking
* Soft deletion where appropriate
* RLS policies
* Migration-based schema changes

Avoid manually modifying production database structures without a documented migration.

Recommended migration workflow:

```text
Development
     ↓
Migration
     ↓
Testing
     ↓
Review
     ↓
Staging
     ↓
Production
```

---

# 18. API Requirements

The backend should provide clear and predictable APIs.

Example:

```text
GET    /api/services
GET    /api/services/:id

POST   /api/services
PATCH  /api/services/:id
DELETE /api/services/:id

GET    /api/departments
GET    /api/news
GET    /api/announcements
```

Administrative endpoints must require appropriate authorization.

Public endpoints should expose only information intended for public consumption.

---

# 19. Performance Goals

The production platform should aim for:

* Fast initial page load
* Responsive mobile experience
* Optimized images
* Lazy-loaded resources
* Efficient database queries
* Minimal unnecessary API requests
* Proper caching where appropriate
* Optimized production builds

Target:

> A citizen using an average mobile device and ordinary Philippine internet connection should be able to access essential municipal information quickly and reliably.

---

# 20. Accessibility Goals

TAL.GOV should be usable by as many citizens as possible.

Target requirements:

* [ ] Keyboard navigation
* [ ] Proper heading hierarchy
* [ ] Accessible forms
* [ ] Alt text for meaningful images
* [ ] Sufficient color contrast
* [ ] Visible focus states
* [ ] Responsive text
* [ ] Screen-reader-friendly navigation
* [ ] Clear error messages

---

# 21. SEO Requirements

Public pages should include:

* Unique page titles
* Meta descriptions
* Canonical URLs
* Open Graph metadata
* Structured headings
* Descriptive URLs
* Sitemap
* Robots configuration
* Indexable public content

Example:

```text
/services/business-permit
/services/civil-registry
/departments/municipal-health-office
/news/municipal-announcement
```

Avoid meaningless URLs such as:

```text
/page?id=173
```

where a meaningful route can be provided.

---

# 22. Testing Requirements

Before merging significant features:

### Functional Testing

* [ ] Feature works as intended
* [ ] Loading states work
* [ ] Empty states work
* [ ] Error states work
* [ ] Invalid input is handled
* [ ] Mobile layout works
* [ ] Desktop layout works

### Security Testing

* [ ] Unauthorized users cannot access protected resources
* [ ] Users cannot access another user's restricted data
* [ ] Admin endpoints enforce roles
* [ ] Storage policies prevent unauthorized access

### Regression Testing

Verify that changes do not break:

* Authentication
* Navigation
* Services
* CMS
* Database operations
* Mobile responsiveness

---

# 24. Definition of Done

A feature is considered **DONE** only when:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Database/API integration
    ↓
Authentication/Authorization
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Responsive UI
    ↓
Error handling

# 27. Development Principles

TAL.GOV should follow these principles:

### 1. Security First

Government systems handle information that must be protected.

### 2. Citizen First

Every feature should provide measurable value to citizens or municipal operations.

### 3. API First

Business logic should not be tightly coupled to a single interface.

### 4. Data Driven

Important municipal information should be structured and queryable.

### 5. Maintainability

Future developers and municipal IT personnel should be able to understand and maintain the system.

### 6. Scalability

Architecture should support future municipal systems without unnecessary rewrites.

### 7. Accessibility

Government information should be accessible to everyone.

### 8. Transparency

System behavior, data ownership, and administrative responsibilities should be clearly documented.

---

# 28. Production Readiness Standard

TAL.GOV should **not** be considered production-ready until the following are verified:

```text

[✓] Secure
[✓] Tested
[✓] Responsive
[✓] Accessible
[✓] Documented
[✓] Backed up
[✓] Monitorable
[✓] Recoverable
[✓] Maintainable
```

The objective is not simply to launch a website.

> **The objective is to establish a reliable digital infrastructure for the Municipality of Talibon.**

---
