(Yvux A. Apawan)

Talibon, officially the Municipality of Talibon (Cebuano: Lungsod sa Talibon; Tagalog: Bayan ng Talibon), is a 1st class municipality that lies in the northernmost part of the island Province of Bohol in Central Visayas, Philippines. It is located approximately 114.8 km North of Tagbilaran City, 611.28 km Southeast of Manila, and 49.01 km Southeast of Cebu City.

Its coastline has significant patches of the Danajon Bank, the only documented double barrier reef in the Philippines that is teeming with bountiful natural marine resources. Hence, Talibon is considered as the official Seafood Capital of Bohol. The municipality is bounded on the North by the Camotes Sea, South by the municipality of Trinidad, East by the municipality of Bien Unido, West by the municipality of Getafe, and Southwest by the municipality of Buenavista. Specifically, it is located within 10\xB0 09\u2019 06\u201D North longitude 124\xB0 17\u2019 25\u201D East latitude.[01]

Accessibility to Talibon from the capital, Tagbilaran City, is facilitated by the western or eastern exits of the Bohol Circumferential Road, located 114.8 and 150 km away, respectively. Alternatively, travelers can reach Talibon through the Loay Interior Road via Loboc and Carmen, which is just 109 km away. It is easily accessible to Cebu City directly by boat, approximately 4 hours (36 nautical miles), and proximity to the province of Southern Leyte by boat via Bato, Ubay, Bohol to Bato Leyte (36 nautical miles) trip, taking approximately 3 hours. It can also be accessed by roll-on roll-off (RORO) ferries or by high-speed catamaran and monohull crafts via Ports of Tubigon or Getafe, followed by an hour or 30-minute journey by road, respectively.

The municipality possesses a total land area of 140.46 sq km, of which about 7.97 sq km or 5.7% is classified as urban, while the remaining 132.49 sq km is rural. It has twenty-five (25) barangays divided into three (3) groups of eight (8) island barangays, nine (9) coastal barangays, and eight (8) inland barangays. Urbanized barangays include Poblaci\xF3n, San Jose, San Francisco, San Isidro, Balintawak, and San Agustin.

According to the 2020 Philippine Statistics Authority Population Census, it has a population of 71,272 people and a population density of 507 people per square kilometer, making it the second-most populous town in Bohol, behind Ubay. It is also the home of some of the world\u2019s most densely populated islands, namely, Nocnocan, Guindacpan, Calituban, and Cataban.[02]

The bustling municipality\u2019s major industries are farming and fishing with major products such as fishculture (which includes bangus, shrimp, and tilapia), banana, coconut, oyster, rice, seaweeds, swine, cassava, corn, and native chicken.[03] It is becoming a leading commercial hub for at least 1,409 registered retailers, wholesalers, and traders, as well as strong presence of banks and other financial institutions in northern part of Bohol. The municipality is also home to one of the branches of Alturas Group of Companies, which has established a mall and supermarket in the area since 2003. It also has a shipyard in Sitio Tabon, Barangay San Francisco since 2024.[04]

The locals are also into making artisanal fish traps, hats, and pottery. Silica, limestone, diorites, sand, iron ore, and gravel are also a large industry at present. These minerals are shipped to Cebu and Iligan aboard bulk carriers and barges as these locations are known for cement production and mineral processing.

Talibon has achieved a significant milestone, securing the 17th position among 1st and 2nd class municipalities in the entire country on the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI) 2024 by the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI). It has also made a huge leap from ranking 336th in 2023 to 178th in 2024 among all local government units. This ranking underscores Talibon\u2019s effective performance and significant improvement across key indicators such as economic dynamism, government efficiency, infrastructure development, resilience, and innovation. The recognition thus solidifies Talibon\u2019s position as a thriving and progressive municipality.[05]

Romanillos, as detailed in his 2022 book History of Bohol (1521-1937): Essays, Notes, and Sources published under the auspices of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, reveals that Talibon became a separate municipality from Inabanga in 1733, with Nicolas Calagan elected as its first mayor. This finding, based on primary sources such as the Las Cosas Notables de los Pueblos de Bohol Legajo 66 No. 3 by the Augustinian Recollect fathers, contrasted with the existing ordinance that officially recognizes Talibon\u2019s founding year as April 22, 1854, which was based on the writings of Atty. Simplicio Apalisok.\n\nNotably, Prof. Romanillos\u2019s work is the most detailed and comprehensive historical reference on Bohol and Talibon to date, combining extensive archival research with critical analysis. Given the NHCP\u2019s endorsement, the use of primary sources, and the scholarly rigor of this publication, this claim carries substantial historical weight. Since official records of mayoral successors from 1733 to 1854, as well as detailed accounts of terms from 1854 to 1912 (based on the 1950 Talibon Postwar Profile edited by Gregorio Eronico), are lost or irretrievable, ongoing efforts are being made to reconcile these historical accounts."

When they found out the officials, including Mayor Maximino Garcia and then-Senator Carlos P. Garcia, had fled to Inopacan, Leyte, they forced the townspeople to form a new government under a young lawyer, Atty. Maximino C. Boiser, Sr., threatening to burn the town if they refused. From 1942 to 1944, Boiser acted as the de facto mayor while Garcia represented the Commonwealth government-in-exile and the guerrilla movement.\n\nOn November 4, 1943, Boiser was unfairly tried by a guerrilla court martial from Tagbilaran for allegedly collaborating with the Japanese. Denied a proper defense, he was found guilty and executed by firing squad at exactly 3 o\u2019clock in the morning in the present-day Talibon Veterans\u2019 Memorial Cemetery. Months after his death, Luis B. Goyeneche was appointed by the guerrillas and became mayor.\n\nLocal historian and educator Gregorio C. Eronico, in his article published in the 1973 Souvenir Program for Talibon Annual Town Fiesta Celebration, argued that Boiser was a misunderstood patriot who took the role of mayor to protect the people of Talibon. Eronico believed Boiser was a martyr who sacrificed himself to save the town from further harm, and his reputation was eventually cleared after the war."
